title: "Setup for GLMM course"
---

1. Please make sure you have the **latest version** of R (3.6.1) installed from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (or at least the latest **major version**, i.e. >= 3.6.0).

2. The RStudio interface is strongly recommended; you can download it [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (get the free Desktop version).

3. Install primary GLMM-fitting packages (and a variety of extras).
Note that this list deliberately takes an [everything-but-the-kitchen-sink](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/everything_but_the_kitchen_sink#English) approach, since it will save time to have everything you might want installed in advance. If you haven't updated your packages in a while, please consider `update.packages()` (use `ask=FALSE` to do them all without asking); however, **do not update if your existing workflow depends on particular versions of a package**. If you have questions or problems, please contact me before the workshop.

```{r pkg1,eval=FALSE}
## modeling packages
mod_pkgs <- c("bbmle", "blme", "brms", "gamm4", "glmmLasso", "glmmML",
              "GLMMadaptive", "glmmTMB", "lme4", "MCMCglmm", "robustlmm",
              "rstanarm", "spaMM")
## miscellaneous/data manipulation
data_pkgs <- c("benchmark", "brglm", "devtools", "emdbook", "MEMSS",
               "plyr", "reshape2", "SASmixed", "tidyverse")
## model processing/diagnostics/reporting
diag_pkgs <- c("afex", "agridat", "AICcmodavg", "aods3", "arm",
               "broom", "broom.mixed", "cAIC4", "car", "coda", "DHARMa",
               "effects", "emmeans", "HLMdiag", "Hmisc", "lmerTest", "multcomp",
               "MuMIn", "pbkrtest", "RLRsim", "rockchalk", "sjPlot",
               "sjstats", "stargazer", "texreg", "tidybayes")
## graphics
graph_pkgs <- c("cowplot", "directlabels",
                "dotwhisker", "GGally", "ggalt", "ggplot2",
                "ggpubr", "ggstance", "gridExtra", "plotMCMC",
                "plotrix", "viridis")

all_pkgs <- c(mod_pkgs,data_pkgs,diag_pkgs,graph_pkgs)
avail_pkgs <- rownames(available.packages())
already_installed <- rownames(installed.packages())
to_install <- setdiff(all_pkgs,already_installed)
if (length(to_install)>0) {
    install.packages(to_install,dependencies=TRUE)
}
```

## optional

These are pieces that we most likely *won't* end up using, or in "demonstration mode" only. Go ahead and try to install them if you have time, but don't worry about it too much.

There is no need to (re)install packages such as `grid`, `nlme`, `MASS`, `mgcv`, as they come with a standard R installation. 

4. If we end up using the `brms` package for Bayesian computation, we will need compilers installed as well: 

> Because brms is based on Stan, a C++ compiler is required. The program Rtools (available on https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) comes with a C++ compiler for Windows. On Mac, you should install Xcode. For further instructions on how to get the compilers running, see the prerequisites section on https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started.

- Windows: download Rtools from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
- MacOS: install Xcode; on recent versions of MacOS you need to open a Terminal, type `xcode-select --install` and then click "Install" and "Agree". (If you have an older version or want more details see [here](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/); you only need to do "Step 1" of these instructions.)
- Linux: make sure you have gcc/g++ installed

5.  Possible extras

```{r get_extras, eval=FALSE}
## maybe get devel version of broom.mixed?
devtools::install_github("bbolker/broom.mixed")
## get INLA (optional!)
source("http://www.math.ntnu.no/inla/givemeINLA.R")
```
